# AI Notes

My personal notes on AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I'm currently
focusing on Computer Vision, but will definitely add more notes on other topics
in the future.

Each folder focuses on a specific topic and is further subdivided into different
methods and applications. The main notes on each subsection are contained in a
PDF file generated from a LaTeX file.

If you have any comments or see any mistakes, please let me know and I can fix it.
I'm also open to adding more collaborators, so just reach out and let me know if
you would like to help out!

## Topics that will be added soon
1. Neural-nets
2. Tensorflow

## Topics that will be added later
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
2. Natural Language Processing (NLPs)
3. Reinforcement Learning
